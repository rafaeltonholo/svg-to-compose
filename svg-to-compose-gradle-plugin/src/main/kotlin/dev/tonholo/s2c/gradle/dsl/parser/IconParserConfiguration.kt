     * E.g:
     * A file named `my_awesome_logo_filled.svg`, without the `mapIconNameTo()`
     * function would generated a ImageVector named `MyAwesomeLogoFilled`.
     *
     * By applying the `mapIconNameTo()` function, as shown bellow:
     * ```kotlin
     * svgToCompose.processor {
     *     val filled by creating {
     *          val themePackage = "my.awesome.app.theme"
     *          from(rootProject.layout.projectDirectory.dir("assets/icons"))
     *          destinationPackage("$themePackage.icons.filled")
     *          optimize(false)
     *          icons {
     *              theme("$themePackage.MyAwesomeAppTheme")
     *              mapIconNameTo { iconName ->
     *                  iconName.replace("_filled".toRegex(), "")
     *              }
     *          }
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     * Whenever a file inside the `assets/icons` folder contains `_filled`,
     * the `Filled` won't be present in the generated `ImageVector` property's
     * name. Thus, the same `my_awesome_logo_filled.svg` would generated an
     * `ImageVector` named `MyAwesomeLogo` instead.
     *
     * @param mapper A function that takes the original icon name
     * and returns the custom name.

     * or `ic_search_outlined.svg` would be included and considered as 'outlined' icons.
